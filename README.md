Software Devlopment

Week 1

During the first week , I delved into the fundamentals of java and gained a comprehensive understanding of its core components. I learned about the importance of semantic elements, which are crucial for defining the distinct sections, thus enhancing its structure, meaning, and accessibility. I also focused on the best practices for writing java code, ensuring proper syntax and organization. While developing a Temperature Conversion Program. It emphasizes the progression from initial setup and research to implementation, testing, and final documentation and presentation. Adjust the details based on the specific tasks.

Day 1:

 Understand the project scope and setup development environment.

 Set up the development environment and created the initial structure of program.

 Reviewed project documentation and initial research on temperature scales.

Day 2:

 Conduct detailed research on temperature scales and conversion formulas.

 Studied conversion formulas and methods (e.g., Celsius to Fahrenheit).

 Designed initial program structure and flowchart.

Day 3:

 Implemented basic conversion functions

 Developed user input/output handling.

 Integrated error handling and validation for input.

Day 4:

 Integrated error handling and validation for input.

 Debugged and fixed issues identified during testing.

 Refactored code for improved readability and efficiency.

Day 5:

 Reviewed and tested the entire application to confirm it meets the requirements.

Week 2

During the second week , i work on Create a Guessing Game. It emphasizes the progression from project setup and design to coding implementation, testing, and final documentation and presentation. Adjust the details based on the specific tasks.

Day-1:

 Understand the project requirements and set up the development environment.

 Installed necessary software tools (IDE, version control) for development.

Day-2:

 Design the structure and logic of the Guessing Game.

 Defined the game rules, including how guesses are processed and validated.

Day-3:

 Implemented basic game functionalities, such as generating a random number and accepting user
guesses.

 Developed the logic to compare user guesses with the correct number and provide feedback.

 Handled edge cases, such as invalid input or out-of-range guesses.

Day-4:

 Conducted unit tests for game functionalities, including random number generation and input validation.

 Identified and fixed bugs and logical errors in the game code.

Day-5:

 Reviewed and finalized the entire application.

Week 3

During third week , This week focused on while developing a Simple Contact Management System. Adjust the details based on the specific tasks and  Design the structure and logic of the Guessing Game.Defined the game rules, including how guesses are processed and validated.Implemented basic game functionalities, such as generating a random number and accepting user guesses.Developed the logic to compare user guesses with the correct number and provide feedback.Handled edge cases, such as invalid input or out-of-range guesses.

Day-1:

 Understand the project requirements and set up the development environment.

 Defined the scope of the system, including basic functionalities like adding, viewing, and deleting
contacts.

 Set up the development environment (IDE, version control) and initialized the project repository.

Day-2:

 Designed the database schema to store contact details (e.g., name, phone number, email).

 Established connections between the application and the database.

Day-3:

 Implemented basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for contacts.

 Developed user interface for adding and viewing contacts.

Day-4:

 Conducted unit tests for CRUD operations, including edge cases and error handling.

 Identified and resolved bugs and logical errors in the application code.

Day-5:

 Reviewed and finalized the entire application.

Week 4

During forth week , program that solves Sudoku puzzles automatically. The program should take an input grid representing an unsolved Sudoku puzzle and use an algorithm to fill in the missing numbers.

Day-1:

 Studied the rules of Sudoku thoroughly to grasp the constraints and requirements for solving the puzzle.

 Analyzed sample Sudoku puzzles to identify common patterns and strategies used in manual solving.

 Designed the initial structure of the program.

Day-2:

 Researched various algorithms commonly used for solving Sudoku puzzles, such as backtracking and
constraint propagation.

 Chose the backtracking algorithm as the primary approach due to its simplicity and effectiveness in
solving Sudoku puzzles.

Day-3:

 Developed the Sudoku Solver using Java, adhering to the principles of object-oriented programming
(OOP) for better organization and modularity.

 Implemented functions to validate the Sudoku board, find empty cells, and attempt to solve the puzzle
recursively using the backtracking technique.

Day-4:

 Ensured the solver handles edge cases and invalid input gracefully, providing appropriate feedback or
error messages.

 Created a suite of test cases to validate the solver's correctness and efficiency.

Day-5:

 Verified that the solver correctly identifies unsolvable puzzles and handles them appropriately.
